Piet Mondrian, a seminal figure in 20th-century abstract art, is renowned for his transformative shift from figurative painting to an evolving abstract style. His artistic trajectory culminated in a distinctive visual vocabulary characterized by simplified geometric elements. Notably, a masterpiece created by Mondrian recently fetched an impressive $50.6 million at auction.

Inspired by Mondrian's profound artistic language, I have meticulously crafted a painting utilizing CSS Grid, drawing parallels to the renowned $50.6 million masterpiece. This endeavor reflects a harmonious convergence of digital design and art history, paying homage to Mondrian's enduring influence on the evolution of abstract art.
